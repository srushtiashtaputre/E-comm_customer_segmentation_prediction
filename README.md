# E-comm_customer_segmentation_prediction
The objective of project is to buit a E-commerce customer Segmentation and prediction Machine learning model.
# Following are Key takeaways:-
In this project I have used RFM(Recency,Frequency,Monatery Value) parameters for identifying customer behaviour.
Clustering algorithm for customer segmentation based ontheir purchasing patterns.
After Clustering applying Classification Algorithm to predict customer cluster and provide churning Chances and marketing Strategies.

# Work Flow

2)Data preprocessing
3)EDA
4)Feature Engineering
5)Clustering Algorithm
4)Classification Algorithm
6)Evaluation
7)Streamlit UI

# Conclusion
Customers are segmented in 4 clusters K-means gives good clustering after comparing with Agglomerative and DBSCAN.
Random forest is used for classifying customer cluster as it gave good accuracy score as compared to other classification algorithms.
